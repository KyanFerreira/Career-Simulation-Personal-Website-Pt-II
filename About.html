    <h2>Excercise</h2> 
 <div class="sectionbox">   
<div class="generalBox  PageBoxColor">
    <p>I am not very interested in running. However that is exactly why I do it. Most things that are good for you are not very
         interesting but they are great for the general up keep of my body and mind. Also if I did not do them my fiance would 
         not be my fiance. I want to live a long life so excercise must be a crucial part of that. Even running my dreaded enemy.</p>

    <h2>Venus the Cat</h2> 
    <div class="sectionbox"> 
<div class="generalBox  PageBoxColor">
    <p>I am the keeper of the greatest cat to ever exist. What makes her the greatest cat you may ask? She does not
     like me. She is not overly friendly. Honestly she cares far more for my fiance than she does for me. However 
     she is a tuexdo cat and always is ready for a fancy night out on the town. Or at least she would be if she could leave 
     the house which she can't because she has no survival instincts at all.
